# gentoo-install-utilities

This is a repository containing many `bash` shell scripts in order to execute basic commands *generally* needed to set up a functional installation of Gentoo Linux.

This is made with the intention to be used in a Stage 3 Live Environment, such as a LiveCD environment, in order to make the installation process easier and quicker.

## **Notes:**

It is heavily advised that the user read through the contents of each script before running them.

The scripts are free to be changed or configured by the user.
